Hi. I’m a self-taught developer, training my skills through code, discipline, and silence.  
Building tools. Breaking systems. Earning my future, commit by commit.

## ⚙️ What I’m working on
- Frontend + Full-Stack projects (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js)
- FreeCodeCamp certifications
- Custom interactive tools and digital rituals
- Slowly shifting into Machine Learning / AI

## 🔧 Tools I use
- VS Code  
- Git & GitHub  
- JavaScript  
- Markdown  
- Terminal (because clicking is loud)

## 📍 Goals
- Become job-ready for a remote dev role by 17  
- Build a portfolio site that feels like an *echo* of my myth  
- Never lose sight of the silence that taught me discipline

## 📁 Current Project
[`the_beginning.js`](./the_beginning.js)  
> _“This is where I start. No more fear, just code.”_

**Everything begins here.**
